    <p> The wonderful world of ducks, what a wonder these little guys can be! With their webbed feet all the way to their broad bills, these guys are diverse and well loved by all! Starting us off strong, did you know that most male ducks choose not to quack? How neat is that! And one of the coolest parts that I am positive humans wish they could do, is Ducks can let one half of their brain sleep, while the other half can stay awake! </p>

    <h2> Lets delve deeper into the pond</h2>
    <p> Deeper into the pond we go, we can see that there is more than one type of duck obviously, there are several! What are some different kinds of Ducks? Lets get in there and find out. </p>

    <h3> The different duckies </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Mallard Ducks; the mallard is a wonderful duck with a unique coloring to its head giving it that green-blue look to it. And only males have this glossy green head with the white collars.</li>
        <li> Canvas backs; these ducks have yet again a unique coloring with red eyes! How spooky. These guys are also known for being North America's largest diving duck. </li>
        <li> Whistling Ducks; Whistling ducks, which are also known as tree ducks are a subfamily of the duck, which would be Goose and the Swan family. They're most commonly known for their unique high-pitched, three-note whistle instead of a quack! How cool can these guys be?</li>
        <li> Alabio Duck; The alabio duck is an indonesian breed of domestic ducks, meaning unlike other ducks, they get to have a nice cared for home usually! They happen to be from North Hulu Sungai Regency, and can fly quite well! These guys also are extremely heat tolerant. </li>
    </ul>
