<h1> Champion of the Rito, Divine beast Vah Medoh. </h1>
<p> Revali, was the champion of the Rito, with a headstrong way of doing things, he was a bit harsh with everyone around him- boasting of his achivements and himself. Though, he did care for them under all that narcissism. </p>

<div class="Bodytwo"> 
<h2> Revali's Legacy </h2>
<p> Revali was strong, no doubt about it. Having one of the strongest abilities when aiding link, and one of the strongest fighters among the champions.  He was arrogant and boastful of his abilities as previously mentioned- although Link does outdo him in some areas leading to the frien-enemies trope that is commonly seen throughout their friendship.   </p>

        <h1> Revali, the top archer. </h1>
        <p> Revali, was a top archer, being fast and quick with his thinking, though he is critical of himself in some ways, determined to get better and stronger- refusing to give himself a break until he suceeds at some things he does for himself. </p>

        <h1> Initially, he does decline. </h1>
        <p> Initially, Revali declines operating a divine beast, as he heard from Zelda when she asked of him- that it would be aiding the Hylian knight, Link.     He disliked the idea of becoming a sidekick to him, disliking the idea that he would go down as the sidekick in this story, though eventually gives in when seeing how Zelda begs for his help for the innocent lives. As he initially had thought that all Hylians, though of themselves only. </p>

        <h3> It is strongly believed that he grew to care more about Zelda than he ever let on, as she changed his mind to believe Hylians do care for other people than themselves. </h3>
