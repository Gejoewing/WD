        <h1> Her Legacy </h1>
        <p> Miphas legacy, continued through her little brother as mentioned, as well through a statue made in her honor. She was a soft hearted leader of which showed her strength in her ability to care for all alongside her ability to wield a trident in battle. 

            <h3> It is expected as well, that she was a love interest for Link. </h3>
            <p> But this, did not halt her character whatsoever, and never did become her main compoment that made her important in the Zelda universe. Her love for link was soft and tender, there was no jealously or hate found between her, and anyone else who was seen as a love interest for Link. As well the developers with thanks, never made it her key attribute in any of her information or story. </p>
