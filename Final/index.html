<h1> If you love games, you know Zelda. </h1>
<p> Love it or hate it, Zelda has been around for ages, and the story telling is immaculate throughout the ages. Though, why is it called Legend of Zelda, when the protagonist is not named Zelda? </p>

<div class="Bodytwo"> 
<h2> His name, is Link. </h2>
<p> Link, is the main character of The Legend of Zelda, and through the ages he has been through more than words alone can express. Every story, and every design of him speaks to a different person as he changes through time along with us. </p>
