<h1> If you love games, you know Zelda. </h1>
<p> Love it or hate it, Zelda has been around for ages, and the story telling is immaculate throughout the ages. Though, why is it called Legend of Zelda, when the protagonist is not named Zelda? </p>

<div class="Bodytwo"> 
<h2> His name, is Link. </h2>
<p> Link, is the main character of The Legend of Zelda, and through the ages he has been through more than words alone can express. Every story, and every design of him speaks to a different person as he changes through time along with us. </p>

        <h1> Link, the Hylian Champion </h1>
        <p> Link, though he is not granted an ability to go with his Champion status in both Tears of the kingdom, and Breath of the wild, he is still a champion, except he posseses a power greater than a divine beast or a sacred ability. </p>
        <h3> Link posses the ability to use the Master Sword, and seal the evil king, Ganondorf. </h3>
        <p> However, this is not all Link can pull off, and possesses.</p>
        <h1> Save me one time, save me two times. </h1>
        <p> Link has saved her highness, princess Zelda, for ages to come in a multitude of different games, however, Link himself saves more than just the princess, he saves all of their world; Hylia, several times using the next gift he has. </p>
