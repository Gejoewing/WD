<h1> Champion of the Gerudo, Divine Beast Vah Naboris</h1>
<p> Urbosa, was a strong woman, of which had a deep love for her home, friends and family. Which as well, stretched out to Zelda and Link, even though Link was a male. 
    Why did it matter that Link was a male? Her tribe of the Gerudo, meant for no Men whatsoever, it was an all female tribe. </p>

<div class="Bodytwo"> 
<h2> Urbosas Legacy </h2>
<p> Urbosa, knew Zeldas mother, which is why it was even harder for her when Zeldas mother had passed away- and as a child, Zelda did not cry as her mothers funeral. To which worried Urbosa. She was chosen to piolet Divine Beast Vah Naboris, as she was a strong leader, with a loving heart. While her people saw this as too dangerous for her. Urbosa, intended to accept this fate to protect not only hryule, but the entire world and her people. </p>

      <h1> The Champion, whose heart went out to the Princess </h1>
      <p> It was no secret that Urbosa cared deeply for Zelda throughout her entire life as previously mentioned. Zelda became a huge part of Urbosas life, and Urbosa intended to protect that, where in a scene we are shown Zelda sleeping on Urbosa after a long tiring day. </p>

      <h1> Please Protect her with your life.</h1>

      <p> Urbosa, requests this of Link, asking him to prptect her with everything he has, even though their relationship was strained from the beginning due to his silent nature.     Though, even with their strained relationship, he protected and cared for her nontheless. </p>
      
      <h3> It is said, without Urbosas help? Link and Zelda, would probably be strained still. </h3>
